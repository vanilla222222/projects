  tidecaller: { id:'tidecaller', name:'The Tide Caller', hp:60, dmg:3, speed:78, radius:29,
    color:'#4fa8d6', dark:'#1f5b80', behavior:'bossTideCaller', stage:7,
    desc:'Beats a three-part bar: an offset ring, a wide aimed fan, then a full-room tide that hauls you toward it for a second and a half while it stands there and fires nothing at all.' },

  maelstrom: { id:'maelstrom', name:'The Maelstrom', hp:58, dmg:3, speed:52, radius:31,
    color:'#2e8ab0', dark:'#123c52', behavior:'bossMaelstrom', stage:7,
    desc:'A two-armed spiral that never stops turning, over a constant inward drag. There is no safe place to stand, only a correct direction to walk: with the spin, against the pull. Below half health it grows a third arm.' },

  leviathanwake: { id:'leviathanwake', name:'The Leviathan Wake', hp:64, dmg:3, speed:74, radius:32,
    color:'#1f5b80', dark:'#0c2c40', behavior:'bossLeviathanWake', burstRadius:62, stage:7,
    desc:'Dives untouchable, crosses the room underneath, and surfaces in a burst. The wake it leaves swells a beat later along the entire line it travelled, so the crossing is a wall and not a dodge.' },

  belldiver: { id:'belldiver', name:'The Bell Diver', hp:62, dmg:3, speed:56, radius:30,
    color:'#8a9aa8', dark:'#424c56', behavior:'bossBellDiver', burstRadius:58, stage:7,
    desc:'Artillery with an escort. It seeds bubble mines around itself on a long clock and walks depth charges onto your feet in between, so you are never fighting only the boss.' },

  siltmonarch: { id:'siltmonarch', name:'The Silt Monarch', hp:66, dmg:3, speed:70, radius:31,
    color:'#a89a7a', dark:'#544c3c', behavior:'bossSiltMonarch', burstRadius:78, stage:8,
    desc:'Above the silt it is a slow, dense ring of thrown grit. Below it, it is untouchable and hunting — and it erupts a geyser at whatever spot it chooses to surface on.' },

  lanternqueen: { id:'lanternqueen', name:'The Lantern Queen', hp:64, dmg:3, speed:84, radius:29,
    color:'#7ae0c0', dark:'#2c6a58', behavior:'bossLanternQueen', stage:8,
    desc:'Lit, she hunts you and fires fast aimed pairs. Dark, she is armoured, anchored, and rings the room with slow walls of light around one rotating gap. Damage only lands in the light.' },

  pressurehulk: { id:'pressurehulk', name:'The Pressure Hulk', hp:72, dmg:4, speed:38, radius:34,
    color:'#4a6a7a', dark:'#22343c', behavior:'bossPressureHulk', stage:8,
    desc:'Fights entirely in shockwaves: three rings back to back, each faster and rotated off the last so the gaps never line up, then a long exhausted window that is the whole fight\'s damage.' },

  eldernautilus: { id:'eldernautilus', name:'The Elder Nautilus', hp:68, dmg:3, speed:76, radius:30,
    color:'#c0a8e0', dark:'#5c4a7a', behavior:'bossElderNautilus', stage:8,
    desc:'Out of the shell it walks a tight orbit, firing along the tangent. Withdrawn it is armoured and spins a double spiral. It swaps on damage taken rather than on a clock, so burst forces the defensive half.' },

  hadalwarden: { id:'hadalwarden', name:'The Hadal Warden', hp:74, dmg:4, speed:70, radius:31,
    color:'#5ae0ff', dark:'#1e5a70', behavior:'bossHadalWarden', stage:9,
    desc:'Plants itself and walks a four-armed cross around the room in fast steps. The arms rotate the whole time, so the safe wedges travel and the room shrinks with every pass. Under 40% it sweeps faster and for longer.' },

  thecrush: { id:'thecrush', name:'The Crush', hp:78, dmg:4, speed:88, radius:32,
    color:'#8a3a4a', dark:'#421c24', behavior:'bossTheCrush', stage:9,
    desc:'Fires nothing at all until it decides to squeeze — and then a ring closes on the entire room with exactly one moving gap in it, opening away from you on purpose. Between squeezes it just walks you down, fast.' },

  smokercolossus: { id:'smokercolossus', name:'The Black Smoker Colossus', hp:80, dmg:4, speed:34, radius:35,
    color:'#2a2a32', dark:'#101016', behavior:'bossSmokerColossus', burstRadius:54, stage:9,
    desc:'Never chases. It erupts delayed column fields in widening rings or walks a line of them straight at you, and keeps a permanent trickle of vents coming, so the pressure is on the room rather than on your position.' },

  trenchmaw: { id:'trenchmaw', name:'The Trenchmaw', hp:76, dmg:4, speed:80, radius:33,
    color:'#6a1e30', dark:'#320e18', behavior:'bossTrenchmaw', stage:9,
    desc:'The trench\'s apex predator drags you toward it for the entire fight. Its bite is a committed two-part run: a wind-up where the pull doubles, then a straight charge that ends in a cone.' },
