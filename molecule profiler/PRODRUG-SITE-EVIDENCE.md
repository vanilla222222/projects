# Documented prodrug site evidence

The Prodrugs tab includes a separate reference-site viewer for valacyclovir, enalapril, capecitabine and parecoxib. Filter ester, amide and carbamate examples separately, select a reference, select an atom, and check its evidence. The selected reference atom is highlighted in the structure. Atom numbers follow that reference SMILES parse order, not IUPAC locants or the atom order of another input.

The viewer filters existing compound-specific relationships; it creates no molecules and does not expand the structural candidate generator. Exact input/reference graph matches include charge, hydrogen counts, isotope and resolved stereochemistry. Unknown queries can inspect references independently, with an explicit warning that the evidence does not apply to their molecule. Reanalysis clears the prior selection/evidence. Selecting an unannotated atom returns unsupported rather than borrowing evidence from another position.

Relationship evidence and structural annotations have different labels. The highlighted atom is an annotation of a known reference functionality, not proof that a single cleavage there releases the final active compound. In particular, capecitabine activation is multistep. No individual conversion speed, completeness, exposure or therapeutic benefit is inferred. The latest selected-site report is available as `PharmacologyUI.getSnapshot().prodrugSiteEvidence`; it is cleared on a changed selection until checked again.

The added amide case is specifically parecoxib's N-acylsulfonamide relationship to valdecoxib. It is not a general rule for amide cleavage or amine derivatization. The displayed neutral structures reuse the repository reference-library records for Parecoxib and Valdecoxib (PubChem CIDs 119828 and 119607); EMA's product assessment concerns parecoxib sodium. No salt-equivalence match is inferred from the neutral graph.

The original three reference structures come from the existing `data/pharmacology-evidence.js` records, which carry their original PubChem structure links. A structural guard withholds an annotation if its expected atom and adjacent carbonyl no longer match. This small annotation set is not a general metabolism map.

Validation uses a focused DOM test covering reference availability, correct highlighting, supported and unsupported atoms, stale-state clearing and multistep evidence labels. No broad model or browser regression is required for this isolated viewer.
